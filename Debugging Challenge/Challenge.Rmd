### Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyver)
```

### Load dataset
```{r, include = FALSE}
challengedata <- read_csv(datachallenge/timeuse_day3_2.csv) 
```

### View
```{r, include = FALSE}
View(challenge) 
```

### View column names
```{r}
name (challengedata) 
```

### Rename columns for clarity 
Rename variables to indicate that it is referring to minutes/day

```{r}
challengedata <- challengedata  
  rename(
    AloneMinutes = durAlone,
    SleepMinutes = durSleep,
    WorkMinutes = durWork,
    StudyMinutes = durStudy
  )
```

```{r}
names(challengedata)
```

### Summary statistics
```{r}
challengedata |>
  summarise (( 
    avg_alone = mean(AloneMinutes, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_sleep = mean(SleepMinutes, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_work = mean(WorkMinutes, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_study = mean(StudyMinutes, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
This indicate on average, how many minutes per day participants spent on each of the selected activities.

### Create new variables to indicate hours instead of minutes
Create new variables to show how many hours per day participants spent on those activities

```{r}
challengedata <- challengedata |>
  mutate(AloneHours = AloneMinutes / 60,
         SleepHours = SleepMinutes / 60,
         WorkHours = WorkedMinutes / 60, 
         StudyHours = StudyMinutes / 60)
```

Check if new variables were added

```{r}
name(challengedata)
```

### Summary statistics: hours
```{r}
challengedata |>
  summarise(
    avg_alone = mean(AloneHours),
    avg_sleep = mean(SleepHours),
    avg_work = mean(WorkHours),
    avg_study = mean(StudyHours)
  )
```
Participants spent on average 10.6 hours alone, 8.7 hours sleeping, 2.8 hours working, 0.1 hours studying or doing homework, and 1.23 hours eating

### Check the distribution of the hours working, and studying  
```{r}
challengedata |> 
  count(WorkHours)  
  arrange(desc(n)) |>  
  head(10) |>
  print()
```

Most participants worked 0 hours the day the data was collected.

```{r}
challengedata |> 
  count(StudyHours) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(10) |>
  print()
```

Most participants spent 0 hours studying the day the data was collected. 

### Data visualizations

Let's create a bar graph that shows amount of participants and the distribution of hours worked that day.

```{r}
ggplot(challengedata aes(x = WorkHours)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  stat_bin(binwidth = 1, geom = "text", aes(label = after_stat(count)),
           vjust = -0.5, color = "black", size = 3) +
   labs(
    title = "Distribution of Daily Work Hours",
    x = "Work Hours",
    y = "Number of Participants"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

If we wanted to only represent participants that worked the day the data was collected:

```{r}
challengedata |>
  filter(WorkHours > 0) |> #filtering to worked more than 0 hours
  ggplot(aes(x = WorkHours)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  stat_bin(binwidth = 1, geom = "text", aes(label = after_stat(count)),
           vjust = -0.5, color = "black", size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Daily Work Hours (Excluding 0 Hours)",
    x = "Work Hours",
    y = "Number of Participants"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
