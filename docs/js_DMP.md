## Data Management Plan for RDM Jumpstart

**Version 1.0, May 5, 2025**

*Please note: This DMP is for training purposes only and does not necessarily reflect all elements that would be required for a full research project.*

The dataset used as the basis for  the RDM Jumpstart project is the “General Social Survey, Cycle 29, 2015 [Canada]: Time Use, Main File” dataset from Statistics Canada; it is available at [https://odesi.ca/en/details?id=/odesi/doi__10-5683_SP3_RDS0CK.xml](https://odesi.ca/en/details?id=/odesi/doi__10-5683_SP3_RDS0CK.xml). Information about how the dataset was compiled is available at the link above. This dataset is licensed under the [Statistics Canada Open License](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/reference/licence); project members will abide by the terms of this license when working with the data and making any products available. Ethics board approval is not required for the use of this dataset; anonymization and de-identification occurred before the dataset was made publicly available. There are no other ethical, legal or commercial considerations anticipated for the use of this dataset.

Active data files will be saved in RData format and .csv format. Documentation that will be created for this project include a readme and a data dictionary. Documentation will be saved in markdown. Images generated as part of the project will be saved in .png format. All files will be named according to a standardized file naming scheme. Data analysis will be conducted using R.

During the active phases of the project, the data, documentation and related materials will be backed up on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform, using servers located in Canada. All materials and files created during a day - including RData files, RMarkdown files, .csv files, and rendered outputs - will be uploaded to OSF at the end of the day. Materials will also be backed up on institutional storage (if program members are using institutional computers) and/or personal devices. Approximately 50MB of storage will be required during the active phases of the project. Files will be accessible to individual members of the program, as well as to instructors who have been added to an individual member’s project.

At the completion of the project, the dataset and accompanying documentation and code will be made available in the RDM Jumpstart collection on the Borealis demo site: [https://demo.borealisdata.ca/dataverse/dv](https://demo.borealisdata.ca/dataverse/dv). Borealis provides a number of benefits both in terms of making data available and in terms of long-term preservation: its servers are hosted in Canada; it has a robust preservation plan (see [https://borealisdata.ca/preservationplan/](https://borealisdata.ca/preservationplan/)); it provides a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) for all datasets; and its metadata are harvested by a number of aggregation services, including Lunaris ([https://www.lunaris.ca/en](https://www.lunaris.ca/en)) and Google Dataset Search ([https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)). All materials will be made available in non-proprietary formats to maximize reusability: data will be made available in .csv format, documentation will be in .md format, and code will be in .Rmd documents. Materials will be licensed under a [Creative Commons 4.0 By Attribution license (CC-BY)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en).
